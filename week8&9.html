		<h2>Independent Learning Task - Analysing Audio </h2>
		
		<p> On the medical futurist web page the audio is used to give snippets of various audio books they have on sale on their web page <P>
		<p> In terms of using audio with intent there is no audio on the web page that enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal <P>
		
		<h3> Advantages of audio </h3>
		<p>	Audio can capture and maintain users' attention, making the content more engaging and memorable and for users with visual impairments, audio can provide an alternative means of accessing information on a website<p>
		
		<h3> Caveats of audio </h3>
		<p> Audio files can increase page load times, affecting the overall performance of a website, especially on slower internet connections and Autoplaying audio can be annoying for users, and some web browsers now block autoplay by default. <p>
		
		<p> audio can be combined with video to enhance multimedia production however in the case of the Medical Futurist there is no examples of this <p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p> I will not plan to include audio in my web page as i do not feel it fits the narrative and overall theme of my topic <p>

		<h2>Independent Learning Task - Analysing Digital Video </h2>
		
		<h3> Analyse the use of video on the web </h3>
		
		<p> The video on the meidcal futurist page is used to explain and demonstrate the use of virtual reality in healthcare and give some positives on this. This video is used with intent and enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal. The length of the video is perfect as it is not too long where the user might lose interest. <p>
		
		<h3> Advantages of Video </h3>
		<P> Video is a highly engaging medium that can capture and hold users' attention, making it effective for conveying information and telling stories and videos are excellent for demonstrating products, providing tutorials, or explaining complex concepts in a more accessible and visually appealing manner.<p>
		
		<h3> Caveats of Video </h3>
		<p> Videos can significantly impact page load times, especially if they are large files and similar to audio, autoplaying videos can be intrusive and disruptive. Users should have the choice to play the video rather than having it start automatically. <p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>Edited Video</h2>
		
		<p> I have put two clips together and faded in the second clip using the effects on OpenShot.User has controls to pause, play and change the volume of the video. However I have removed the audio of the video. <p>
