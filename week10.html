		<h2>Independent Learning Task -  Evaluating accessible design</h2>
		
		<p> Creating an accessible website is crucial for ensuring that everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can navigate and engage with the content effectively.
		From a user perspective, it's about inclusivity. I want everyone to feel welcome and have an equal opportunity to interact with the content on my web page.
		That means implementing features like alternative text for images, ensuring compatibility with screen readers, and employing a clear and logical site structure. <p>
		
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>Other forms of accessibility</h2>
		
		<p> Screen Reader Compatibility: Ensure that the content and functionality of the website are accessible to screen reader users. This involves providing descriptive text for images (alt text), proper heading structures, and ensuring that dynamic content is announced accurately. <p>
		<p> Keyboard Navigation: Design the website so that all functionality can be operated through a keyboard. Users who cannot use a mouse rely on keyboard navigation, so it's crucial to make all interactive elements accessible via keyboard input. <p>
		<p> Contrast and Color Choices: Use sufficient color contrast to make text and interactive elements easily distinguishable. This is especially important for users with visual impairments or color blindness. <p>
		<p> Font and Text Size: Allow users to adjust the font size without causing loss of content or functionality. Some users may require larger text for readability. <p>
		<p> Descriptive Links and Buttons: Ensure that links and buttons have clear and concise labels or text. This helps users with screen readers and those navigating via keyboard to understand the purpose of each element. <p>
        <p> Multimedia Accessibility: Provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content. This benefits users who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who may not be able to view the content. <p>
		<p> Consistent Navigation: Maintain a consistent and predictable navigation structure throughout the website. This helps users with cognitive disabilities or those who rely on consistent navigation patterns. <p>
