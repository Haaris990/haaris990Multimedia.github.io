		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p> After reviewing many sources and articles I had narrowed down my topic to be in either the Virtual Reality field or in the field of Artificial Intellegnce. I have deceided to go down the path of Virtual Reality and more specifically the impact of Virtual Reality in healthcare and the medicine industry. Some of the questions I want my webiste to answer will inlcude "the use of Virtual Reality in medicinal and healthcare training and its benefits", "how virtual reality can help with mental health patients" and "how virtual reality can help treat cognitive disorders"  </p>
