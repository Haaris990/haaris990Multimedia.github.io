		<h2>Independent Learning Task - Review professional writing characteristics</h2>
            
        <p> The website I have is https://medicalfuturist.com/</p>
		
            <p> Accuracy - The text is acurate throughout all the scholarly articles surrounding my chosen topic and all the points made are backed up by arguments either through other cited work or through research conducted by those writing the article </p>
            
            <p> Active Voice - All articles in this website use the activate voice and it is used correctly.</p>
            
            <p> Limit Biases - I have found there is racial bias in the webiste as the website is only available in English therefore is limited to English speaking individuals. There is also a bias towards all technology in healthcare being a positive impact without looking at any implications or consequences of this</p>
            
            <p> Clarity - The webitse does well to use language the is clear and recognisable. Any terms related to healthcare or medicien have been explained and there are analogies or comparisions made to help readers understan complicated concepts</p>
            
            <p> Conciseness - The webpage is concice and does a good job of keeping the information clear and helps break up long paragraphs of information through images and videos</p>
            
            <p> Conversational - The website has used contractions to ensure the text seems more conversational such as using you've instead of you have which gives the text a conversational tone</p>
            
            <p>Correctness - The webpage has used correct grammar and correct puncatuation throughout all its articles</p>
            
            <p> Parallelism - After looking through many of the articles available on the webpage I have seen very limited examples of parallelism</p>
            
            <p> Positive Voice - The webpage is very upbeat on the advancement of technology in healthcare and speaks in a very positive tone</p>
            
            <p> Strong Nouns and Verbs - The website has used nouncs and verbs to emphasise their points however at some points there is a slight over use of verbs</p>
            
            <p> Sentence Variety - There is limited variety in the beginning of the sentices and in the sentence lengths. A lot of the sentences start with the same few words.</p>
            
            <p> Simple words - The website has some complex words which the average reader may be unaware of (for example gastrointestinal) however on the whole the articles contain simple words.</p>
            
            <p> Shorter Paragraphs - This webpage does well to ensure that most paragraphs are betwen 6 to 8 lines</p>
            
            <p> Tone and Voice - This webpage has a mix of formal and informal voice due to the nature of the topic being quite objective however is being said in a conversational way </p>
            
            <h3> Reflective Statement</h3>
            
            <p> In delving into the impact of virtual reality on cognitive rehabilitation, I've conscientiously navigated the Assess step of the writing process. Defining my audience and purpose has provided a compass for my exploration, ensuring clarity in my communication. The research undertaken to understand the intricacies of virtual reality's influence on cognitive rehabilitation has been both informative and demanding. I've gone through a variety of sources, keeping a keen eye on credibility and relevance.</p>
